### 06th January 2006
What is RetroShare? and Why another Peer to Peer Network?

RetroShare is the next generation sharing network, which provides:

 - A Private Peer to Peer Network which allows you to share information 
   with only the people you want to.
 - Reliable Identification and Authentication of your friends.
 - Plus an Introduction Scheme which connects you to the friends of your 
   friends, and facilitates network growth.
 - Encrypted Communication, ensuring all shared information is known 
   only to you and your peers.
 - A Communication Platform which can potentially support services such 
   as Secure Email, File Sharing, Video or Voice over IP and Messaging
 - A Decentralised Social Sharing Network designed **For the People**
 - with no dependancies on any corporate system or central servers. 

The problem with existing filesharing networks is that you have no 
control over who you share information with. I don't want to share 
with the whole wide world, but I would love to share stuff with my 
friends. But this is not easy to do, safely and securely, over the Internet.

Current filesharing systems also suffer from bad quality of 
downloadable information. Often the filenames do not correspond 
to what you actualy get. You are getting (potentially random) 
information from a collection of random people. I want to share 
good information with, and only with, the people I trust.

RetroShare is my solution to these problems: A simple filesharing 
program which connects you and your friends together for safe and 
secure sharing.

I have put months of work into transforming RetroShare from a random idea, into a working system. It is now time to share this program, and the ideas behind, with the world...
